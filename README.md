# Create a Simple Shell Script for Backup
A simple bash script for automating daily backups using `tar`, `cp`, and `date`.


## Usage
- Make the script executable:
    ```sh
    chmod u+x backup.sh
    ```


- Define your source and backup directories:
    ```sh
    SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source/folder"
    BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup/folder"
    ```
  Replace them with actual paths.


- Run the script:
    ```sh 
    ./backup.sh
    ```
